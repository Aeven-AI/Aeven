English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

`@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm-pi-ai` is the pi-ai-backed multi-provider adapter for the harness LLM service: one plugin instance owns a dictionary of provider routes, each served through [`@earendil-works/pi-ai`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@earendil-works/pi-ai). A route naming an installed pi-ai provider inherits its endpoint, wire protocol, and model catalog as defaults; a route pi-ai does not ship is declared outright, so an OpenAI-compatible gateway or self-hosted server is configuration, not a code change. Profiles and credentials resolve per request over the optional settings and credential seams, so editing the user settings document changes the next request without a restart. A provider that ships a login can be signed into through the harness authorization seam, and the stored sign-in — an OAuth grant, or a key typed into pi-ai's own login prompt — authenticates its route and refreshes itself under the store's cross-process lock. The plugin can mount dormant with zero routes and activate them the moment a settings section supplies profiles.

## Use this package

Mount this plugin when a composition routes model requests through pi-ai's provider catalogs or through gateways that pi-ai's installed catalog does not describe. The `providers` dictionary is the whole configuration surface: each key is the provider route name a request selects with `GenerateOptions.provider`.

### When to choose it

Choose this adapter when the same composition serves several providers, when a route needs pi-ai's catalog defaults with a few fields corrected, or when a hand-declared gateway must be reached through its own endpoint and protocol. Choose `dsh-llm-deepseek` for the direct DeepSeek route when the deployment needs no other provider. Both adapters can be mounted together because their route names do not collide; registering a route another adapter already owns fails plugin loading.

### Configure provider routes

Each profile may set a `retryPolicy`; omission uses normal mode with five retries. `apiKeyEnv` is a credential reference resolved per request through the harness credential seam, so no secret enters the configuration file; a reference that resolves to nothing fails the request with `MISSING_CREDENTIAL`. Omitting it leaves the route configured-but-keyless, which for an installed catalog route defers to pi-ai's provider-native ambient discovery.

### Sign in to a provider

A provider pi-ai ships a login for can be signed into through the harness authorization seam: the flow offers OAuth or an interactive key prompt (a key is typed into pi-ai's own login prompt, not into the settings form), and the resulting credential is stored in the harness credential store at `llm-pi-ai/<provider id>`. The stored sign-in authenticates its route beneath any `apiKeyEnv` override and refreshes itself under the store's cross-process lock; signing out deletes the stored record. A hand-declared route key outside the record grammar — a lowercase hyphenated identifier — cannot be signed into, because a record write for it refuses with `LlmError('UNSTORABLE_PROVIDER_ID')`; such a route authenticates through `apiKeyEnv` or ambient provider settings instead.

### Resolve the model catalog

A profile's `models` list replaces the route's installed catalog rather than extending it; each entry defaults its unset fields from the installed model of the same id, so narrowing a route to two models, correcting one capacity, or adding a model newer than the installed catalog are one-line edits. `modelOverrides` reshapes individual installed-catalog models without that cost — correct one model, keep the other thirty-seven — and is refused when set beside a `models` list, on a hand-declared route, or naming a model the catalog does not describe, because a silently unchanged model would be a typo someone hunts for later.

### Run with reasoning and wire compatibility

The installed catalog is a snapshot regenerated on pi-ai's own cadence, so a route serving it lags whatever the provider currently lists. `catalogRefresh` closes that gap for a provider publishing an OpenRouter-style `GET /models` document: name its `url` (and optionally a `timeoutMs`, default ten seconds) and the route fetches that document once at mount, adds every published model the snapshot does not describe, and re-resolves so the additions reach selectors. Against OpenRouter's live endpoint this takes the route from the 346 models the snapshot ships to 433.

The refresh is **additive by contract**: a published entry never replaces an installed one. The snapshot carries hand-tuned `compat` and `thinkingLevelMap` values the document does not express — reasoning dialects, developer-role support, per-level wire spellings — so rewriting an installed entry from the document would silently downgrade models that work today. Correcting an installed model stays `modelOverrides`. An added model declares only what the document implies: its capacities, its accepted modalities, and, when it advertises a reasoning parameter, the OpenRouter reasoning dialect with low/medium/high levels. Everything else is left for a `models` entry to state rather than guessed.

`format` names the published layout. `openrouter` (the default) states capacities, modalities, and accepted parameters at the top of each entry. `openai-models` is the plain OpenAI `GET /models` listing, which providers extend under `metadata` — DeepInfra puts capacities, per-token prices, and capability tags there. A published output cap counts only when it is smaller than the window the entry materializes with, because DeepInfra copies `metadata.context_length` into `metadata.max_tokens` for every entry carrying both: a whole-window cap is no cap. The model's own vendor answers instead: a published id is vendor-prefixed, and when that prefix names an installed provider and the remainder is one of its ids — `anthropic/claude-opus-5` — the vendor's output cap is the model's, which DeepInfra's own per-model document confirms by refusing 128,001 tokens for that model while stating no cap of its own. A cap from neither source leaves the route's `defaultMaxTokens`. `requireTags` keeps a text route clean when a provider lists image, audio, and embedding models in the same document: `[chat]` admits only entries carrying that tag.

### Known routes

Some providers publish a usable model document but are absent from pi-ai's catalog entirely. `dsh-llm-pi-ai` carries a small table of these — currently **DeepInfra** — supplying the protocol, endpoint, credential reference, and refresh a profile would otherwise have to state. They appear in the configurable-provider directory beside pi-ai's own, so adding a credential is the whole step:

```yaml
llm-pi-ai:
  providers:
    deepinfra:
      apiKeyEnv: DEEPINFRA_API_KEY
```

That resolves to `openai-completions` against `https://api.deepinfra.com/v1/openai`, refreshing from `/models` with `format: openai-models` and `requireTags: [chat]` — 106 chat models out of the 190 entries the document publishes. Every default is a default: a profile that states its own `baseURL`, `displayName`, `models`, or `catalogRefresh` overrides the table.

A known route's models come only from its document, and resolution runs before the first fetch answers, so such a route resolves with an empty catalog exactly once instead of being refused. An empty route serves no request and stays out of the browser catalog until its models arrive. A route that is neither a catalog route nor a known one, and lists no models, is still refused — nothing would ever fill it.

A route earns a place in that table only when its models can be maintained without anyone editing configuration. A provider whose models would have to be hand-listed belongs in a deployment's own settings, where the list is visibly owned, rather than in a shipped table that would rot exactly as the pi-ai snapshot does.

The refresh is best-effort. A document that is unreachable, slow past `timeoutMs`, or malformed logs a warning and leaves the route serving the snapshot, because a provider's list being briefly unavailable must not take the route down with it. A `catalogRefresh` block that names no `url` is refused at resolution instead, since nothing else in the profile can supply the document's location. A route whose installed models disagree on a protocol, or that resolves no endpoint, is skipped with a warning: an added model has no single `api` and `baseURL` to inherit, and must be named on the route.

`reasoningEfforts` declares a model's selectable thinking levels: each key is a level selectors offer, its value the spelling dispatch sends on the wire, so `max: ultra` renames a level for a gateway with its own vocabulary. Omitting the field keeps the installed catalog entry's capability; `false` declares a non-reasoning model. `compat` switches reshape the request for endpoints pi-ai cannot recognize — which role carries the system prompt, which field caps output, how a thinking level travels — configurable per route and per model. A model neither the entry nor the installed catalog sizes takes the route's `defaultContextWindow` and `defaultMaxTokens` fallbacks. An output cap above the window it is bounded by is no capability either — nothing emits more than its whole window — so the route's `defaultMaxTokens` answers for it and for the request default it would have set, while a cap equal to its window stays legal, that being how a model with no distinct output limit is stated.

### Change configuration at runtime

Profiles are re-read once per operation through the optional settings seam: the base and the user's `llm-pi-ai:` settings section merge per provider, so a user can add a route, override one field of a composition route, or point a route at another proxy, all effective on the next request with no restart. A section the adapter could not serve is refused where it is written — `settings.mutate` answers `settings-rejected` — and a stored section that later fails keeps the namespace's last good value. When the route set or a route's retry policy changes, the plugin re-registers atomically: a conflicting route leaves the previous routes serving.

### Discover models from endpoints

The plugin answers "which models can this provider serve?" for a route a configuration surface is editing or drafting. A route the installed catalog ships is answered from that catalog with no network call; only a route the catalog does not describe is interrogated over the wire. A route the known-route table describes answers for the fields that table owns: the endpoint and protocol `resolveProfiles` reads off it, so a provider configured with a credential alone is interrogated without the form naming either, and the reply is filtered by that route's own `requireTags` — the same signal the refresh reads — so a text route offers only the entries it can serve. An endpoint or protocol the draft states itself still wins, which is how a known route pointed at a proxy is asked where the draft says. `openai-completions` and `openai-responses` use `GET {baseURL}/models` with bearer auth, while `anthropic-messages` uses native `GET /v1/models?limit=1000` semantics with `x-api-key` and `anthropic-version`; its listing URL accepts the API root with or without a trailing `/v1` because gateway documentation publishes both spellings, and only that listing URL normalizes the segment, so model requests receive the configured `baseURL` unchanged. A named configured route supplies its stored credential and profile `headers` inside the Host, so deployment headers configured through `settings.yaml` or Cordis config reach model discovery without becoming discovery-request or Models-page fields; a key typed into the form still wins over the stored credential. The parser accepts either the standard `data` array or an enriched `models` map, normalizing each candidate's id, display name, context window, and output-token cap; Anthropic's `max_input_tokens` and `max_tokens` feed the same capacity fields, a map key remains the request id even when its entry names a different canonical id, primitive-valued map properties are ignored, and a missing display name falls back to that request id. The reply is candidate metadata a surface may offer for adoption — nothing is stored, and `settings.yaml` remains the only thing that decides what a route serves.

### Failures and recovery

A route pi-ai does not ship needs `api`, `baseURL`, and a non-empty `models` list; an unserviceable profile is refused where it is written, naming the route and model. Failures carry stable codes: a credential that cannot be used fails with `INVALID_CREDENTIAL` naming the route and reference, a route whose `apiKeyEnv` reference resolves to nothing fails with `MISSING_CREDENTIAL`, an unconfigured model fails with `UNKNOWN_MODEL`, and terminal provider failures distinguish `QUOTA` from transient `RATE_LIMIT`. `GenerateOptions.stop` is rejected with `UNSUPPORTED_OPTION` because pi-ai's common streaming UI cannot guarantee it across providers.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

This section explains the design behind the adapter; the observable behavior is fully covered in [Use this package](#use-this-package).

### Design philosophy

The adapter is built on immutable snapshots and per-operation resolution. Each operation captures a whole snapshot — the profiles plus a `createModels()` collection holding the `Provider` each route built — before its first `await`, and a configuration change builds a new collection rather than mutating the one in use, so a request that started under one configuration never finishes under another. A route's own credential reference resolves through the harness seam and rides as the request's `apiKey` option, which pi-ai treats as the highest-priority auth override — that is what keeps the fail-loud reference semantics. Everything that override does not cover reaches pi-ai through the collection's own auth: the credential store holds the records a login wrote and a refresh rotates (addressed as `llm-pi-ai/<provider id>`), and the auth context answers the ambient questions a provider asks while resolving. Both are stable across snapshots, so a configuration change rebuilds the collection without forgetting who is signed in.

| [`src/discovery.ts`](src/discovery.ts) | Endpoint interrogation for configuration surfaces |

### Registration and directory

The plugin declares every installed catalog provider it can authenticate in the configurable-provider directory, joined with every route the current profiles declare, so configuration surfaces can offer the full catalog before any route exists. Each entry carries `declared` — whether pi-ai ships nothing under that key — because only the adapter can distinguish a hand-declared route from a narrowed catalog route. Route registration is atomic: a candidate set that collides with another adapter leaves the previous routes serving. A bare mount with zero routes is the dormant posture: nothing registers until a settings section supplies profiles, and routes drop when it empties.

### Replay and vocabulary

Successful assistant responses store a versioned, lossless-JSON replay state beside the provider and model that produced them — response-level facts plus one per-block entry per streamed block. At request time, `LlmRuntime` passes replay state only when the same adapter instance owns both routes; the adapter validates it and restores native response ids and provider signatures, degrading an unusable state to provider-neutral content instead of failing the request. pi-ai tool-call arguments are parsed objects, so the adapter parses input and re-stringifies output to the harness raw-JSON convention; pi-ai in-stream error events map to terminal `finish` chunks.

## Model Experience

### Provider request through pi-ai

#### What the model sees

The selected catalog model receives `GenerateOptions.system`, history, tools, and sampling fields supported by pi-ai's common streaming API. Each retained image is preceded by text naming its complete attachment id and actual request dimensions. When the current execution filesystem maps the attachment provider's host object, the text also carries a read-only normalized-object path and warns that normalization or request projection may have resized or re-encoded the upload. When accumulated base64 image payload exceeds the route's `maxRequestImageBytes`, each offloaded image keeps its own identity and currently resolved access in replacement text. Offloaded normalized attachments are not read or transformed. Provider-native replay metadata is restored only when the adapter validates it for the historical content.

#### Token effect

Provider tokenization governs exact input. Retained images add the stable attachment and coordinate descriptor; the offload placeholder replaces an omitted image's visual tokens. Replay metadata may let a native API reuse provider-side state.

#### KV Cache effect

Conversion preserves logical request order, while image handles and offload placeholders add model-visible text. A changed execution-world path rewrites a historical handle and can prevent reuse from that image even when attachment identity and request bytes stay stable. Changing adapter instance, provider, model, or another upstream token has the same suffix effect. Crossing the image bound replaces an earlier image with placeholder text, so reuse ends at that message until the offloaded prefix stabilizes.

### Provider response

#### What the model sees

pi-ai events become harness reasoning, text, tool-call, usage, and finish chunks. The adapter passes parsed tool arguments to the harness as raw JSON strings.

#### Token effect

Generated content affects later inputs only after the loop records it. pi-ai folds reasoning tokens into output usage when the provider does not report them separately, and preserves its exact `totalTokens` value unchanged.

#### KV Cache effect

Recorded response content appends to the next request and does not invalidate its earlier reusable prefix. Unrecorded transport metadata and usage accounting do not affect cache identity.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define where the adapter stops and future work begins. They are current package constraints, not a general pi-ai comparison or a task backlog.

- **`maxRequestImageBytes` counts base64 image payload only** — text, tools, descriptors, and JSON structure ride outside the bound, so it must sit below the gateway's request-body cap with headroom. Offload is a deterministic request projection and is not recorded as a session event.
- **A sign-in lives only in the process that started it** — an authorization attempt is not durable, so reloading the page mid-login abandons it and the human starts over. Signing out is `deleteRecord` on the stored record, which forgets it locally without telling the issuer.
- **Provider-native discovery answers through this plugin's ambient context** — a route naming no credential defers to the catalog provider's own resolution, which asks for environment values (`AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AWS_PROFILE`, and each provider's own set) and for local credential files. Both questions are answered here: the credential seam is consulted before the process environment, and file existence is checked against the host process's filesystem with `~` expanded. What it cannot do is *read* a credential file's contents — a provider that parses `~/.aws/credentials` itself does so directly, outside the seam.
- **Settings can add or override routes, not remove composition routes** — the user layer merges over the composition base, so deleting a `cordis.yml`-provided provider is a composition change.
- **The layered merge has no delete for dict keys** — a `reasoningEfforts` level, `modelOverrides` entry, or `compat` field the base declares can be overridden but not removed by the user layer.
- **`headers` can carry a credential the redactor never sees** — profile resolution rejects names and values Fetch cannot represent, but the dict remains plain strings; store credentials as `apiKeyEnv` references.
- **A route's catalog never refreshes itself** — the catalog is whatever `settings.yaml` says; nothing here queries a provider for the models it serves.
- **Anthropic discovery reads at most 1,000 models** — the request uses the API's maximum page size but does not traverse `has_more`; entries beyond the first page must be added by hand.
- **One wire protocol per route** — a mixed-protocol catalog route cannot host a model of the other protocol; splitting the provider across two route keys is the workaround.
- **A modality declaration is not verified** — a model declaring `image` its gateway does not serve is refused by the provider after prompt admission. The durable image remains in history and the same misdeclared model can fail again; switching to a text-only model remains possible because the shared LLM runtime projects image references into stable text for that request.
- **An unauthenticated route depends on its protocol** — a route naming no credential resolves as configured-but-keyless, but pi-ai's OpenAI-compatible implementation still requires an API key or an `Authorization` header, so a keyless local server needs a placeholder credential referenced by `apiKeyEnv` or an `Authorization` entry in `headers`.
- **`GenerateOptions.stop` is unsupported** — pi-ai's common stream options cannot guarantee stop-sequence behavior across providers.
- **In-history `system` messages use pi-ai's common context conversion** — provider-specific placement follows pi-ai rather than a harness-owned wire override.
- **Provider HTTP status is unavailable** — pi-ai error events do not expose a stable HTTP status across providers.
- **Retry policy is provider-owned, not an SDK retry** — pi-ai SDK retries stay disabled so durable agent steps and `llm/retry` events own every visible attempt, and direct `ctx.llm.stream()` calls remain single-attempt.

### Dev Note

<details>
<summary>Working context for maintainers — click to expand</summary>

This Dev Note is non-authoritative working context: undecided directions and notes for maintainers. Shipped behavior and accepted rationale live in the sections above, the package code, and the linked Agent Notes.

- The offered protocol set is deliberately narrower than pi-ai's full API set: Bedrock, Vertex, Azure, and Codex authenticate through flows a profile cannot completely describe with a key, an endpoint, and headers; catalog routes still reach them through their own provider, and only an explicit override is refused. Codex is sign-in-able through the authorization flow's OAuth grant.
- The `compat` switch set is pinned to pi-ai's compat types by drift gates; an upstream upgrade that adds a field, gives a further protocol a compat type, or widens a value union fails the build until someone classifies it.
